# reddit_classifier
In this project, I created a machine learning model to predict which subreddit (r/movies, r/WTF, r/funny, r/pics) a reddit post belonged to based on the title and other metadata.  It includes exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, feature engineering, data preprocessing, machine learning implementation, hyperparameter tuning, and model testing.  The final model achieved a macro F1-score of 78%.

I also performed an analysis on which words in the post titles contribute to positive or negative sentiment for each subreddit.
